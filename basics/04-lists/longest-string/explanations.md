# Assignment

Write a function `longest_string(strings)` that, given a list of strings, returns the longest one.

This is kind of like finding a maximum, but not quite. Using `max(strings)` would
return the string that comes last alphabetically: `max('z', 'aaa')` yields `z`.
So, we cannot rely on `max`. Or can we?
