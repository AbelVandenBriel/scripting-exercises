# Assignment

I/O, i.e., reading data from and writing data to the external world,
is a core aspect of scripting. Typical examples are files and network sockets.

Let's start simple. Write a function `read_file(filename)` that
reads the contents of the file named `filename` and returns it as a string.
You'll have to [look online](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+read+file+to+string) for
how to do this. It's strongly recommended you find a piece of code that
involes the `with` construct.
